// Words to add to the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary

// handcraft/noPronounce.txt does not apply to the words in this file but
// handcraft/noSpell[Explicit].txt does

// These words and pronunciations are parsed the same way as the CMU
// Pronouncing Dictionary, but parenthesized numbers are not required if a
// word has multiple pronunciations

// After modifying this file, delete data/pronouncer.txt as well as
// cache/book0.txt through cache/book9.txt and rerun getData.py.
// data/speller.txt will be automatically deleted and regenerated as well.
